# cs161
## A place for our code
___

Some of the Winter 2022 cs161a class set this up to track their code over time, and provide a repo of assignment submission for future refernce by other students. It might be fun to come back and look at how our code has evolved over time. 

Any program in this repo can be called by passing a file path, sans "cpp" to the runcpp script. 
Example: 
```
./runcpp ianlmk/discussions/discussion4
```
